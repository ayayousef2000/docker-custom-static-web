## Static Site Deployment

**Objective**: To automate the deployment of a static website, generated using MkDocs, from a GitHub repository to Yandex Object Storage, and to analyze alternative technologies and approaches.

**Process Overview**: To achieve this objective, a CI/CD pipeline was implemented using GitHub Actions. This process automatically builds the site upon every push to the main branch of the repository and uploads the resulting files to a public Yandex Object Storage bucket configured for website hosting.

## Custom Static Web

**Objective**: To create a unique, custom theme for a static website generated by MkDocs. The primary goal is to develop a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automates typography enhancement, CSS processing, HTML minification, and final deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Process Overview**: The objective was achieved by integrating a Node.js-based build system into an MkDocs project. The pipeline, defined in `package.json` and orchestrated by a GitHub Actions workflow, first processes all source files (improving typography and compiling CSS). It then builds the static site with MkDocs and finally minifies the HTML output before deploying the optimized artifacts to GitHub Pages.
