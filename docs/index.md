# Custom Static Website Project

This page documents the steps taken to create this custom static website using MkDocs, Bootstrap, and a professional GitHub Actions pipeline.

### Core Technologies Used

— **Site Generator**: MkDocs

— **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)

— **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

— **Build Pipeline**: Node.js, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, Typograf, html-minifier

### Report on Project Development

This report outlines the sequential steps that were undertaken to construct, customize, and automatically deploy a professional static website. The project’s objective was to build a site from the ground up, implementing a custom theme and a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline for optimization and deployment.

#### Phase 1: Project Foundation and Environment Configuration

1. A project directory was established, and a local Git repository was initialized for version control.
2. Isolated development environments were prepared. A Python virtual environment was created for the MkDocs static site generator, and a Node.js project was initialized to manage the front-end build pipeline.
3. Initial configuration files (`mkdocs.yml`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`) were created to define the site structure, manage dependencies, and exclude unnecessary files from version control.

#### Phase 2: Content Authoring and Custom Theme Development

1. A logical directory structure for theme assets and Markdown content was created.
2. Content for the site’s pages—Home, About, and Projects—was authored in Markdown format.
3. A custom theme was developed using a master HTML template (`main.html`). This template was structured with Jinja2 placeholders to allow for the dynamic insertion of Markdown content.
4. The **Bootstrap 5** framework was integrated via its CDN to provide a responsive grid system and foundational component styles for the theme.
5. A custom stylesheet (`custom.css`) was written to supplement and customize the default Bootstrap styles, ensuring the final appearance was unique. A custom header, navigation bar, and footer were designed and implemented using Bootstrap components and custom CSS.

#### Phase 3: Implementation of the Professional Build Pipeline

1. Node.js dependencies required for the advanced build process were installed. These included tools for typography enhancement (`typograf`), CSS processing (`postcss`, `autoprefixer`), and HTML optimization (`html-minifier`).
2. The build pipeline was configured. A script was written to automatically process and improve the typography of all Markdown content. PostCSS was configured to add vendor prefixes to the custom stylesheet for improved cross-browser compatibility.
3. A series of build commands were defined within the `package.json` file, creating a master script that could execute the entire build sequence—typography, CSS processing, site generation, and HTML minification—in the correct order.

#### Phase 4: Automation and Deployment

1. A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow was designed and implemented using GitHub Actions.
2. The workflow was configured to be triggered automatically upon any push to the repository’s `main` branch.
3. Steps within the workflow were defined to check out the source code, set up both Python and Node.js environments, install all dependencies, and execute the master build command.
4. The project source code was pushed to a remote GitHub repository.
5. GitHub Pages was configured as the deployment target, with the source set to be the artifacts generated by the GitHub Actions workflow.

**Following these refinements, the final, optimized website was successfully built and deployed to GitHub Pages, fulfilling all project requirements.**
